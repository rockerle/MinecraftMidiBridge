# Minecraft Midi Bridge
A small "couple hour weekend project" for using a Midi device in Minecraft.
If you stumble across this repo if you have Midi Instruments/Devices.

The default keaybinding for opening the menu is J

Funktionality:

- [x] Adding a menu for easy usage
- [x] Selecting one of all Midi devices
- [x] Button for closing all open Midi devices
- [x] Closing Midi devices when leaving a world/server
- [ ] Splitting the Keyboard in Octaves (12 notes per scale) or "Minecraft Scales" (24 notes + one I choose to ignore)
- [ ] Selecting different instruments for every keyboard split
- [ ] Funny little etc.

Annotations:
- Vanilla Minecraft Noteblocks have a weird scaling from F# to F#''', but for easy partitioning of the Keyboard I neglected the 25th note.
- GUI looks pretty ~~ass~~ janky @ some corners
- Select Instrument Screen is under heavy construction
